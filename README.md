# Would You Rather Project

This project is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

## Overview

It's a simple voting game app, users can vote and make polls with only two options to choose from. There's also a leader board with each user's score. The more questions you create or answers you submit, the higher you go on the leader board.

## Installation Guide

To get started developing right away:

-   install all project dependencies with `npm install`
-   start the development server with `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
